# Data_Project-Analyzing_technology_trends_in_patent-based_blockchain_technology_redefining_processes_2021
#
## First, collect data from three perspectives
- Collect Technology keywords (Collect by Blockchain Documents)
- Collect Trend keywords (Collect keywords by USPTO.py + Analysis Trend Keywords.py)
- Collect Internal keywords (Collect 'blockchain' Keyword by USPTO.py)
#
## Second, define blockchain-related terms based on criteria
- Core Blockchain: Include in 3 keywords
- Extend Blockchain: Include in 2 keywords
- General Blockchain: Remaining Keywords
#
## Third, collect USPTO patents for each defined blockchain (Period: 2010.01.01~2020.06.30) (Collect keywords by USPTO.py)
- Core Blockchain Patetns
- Extend Blockchain Patents
- General Blockchain Patents
#
## Forth, each collected patent depicts a CPC network over time. (co-occurrence) (CPC co-occurrence Matrix.py)
- Core Blockchain CPC Network (period 1 ~ period 3)
- Extend Blockchain CPC Network (period 1 ~ period 3)
- General Blockchain CPC Network (period 1 ~ period 3)
#
## Last, CPC Network Analysis (Use Gephi Programming)
- Analysis of CPC network trends over time
- Analysis of Technology Convergence by Technology Redefine
